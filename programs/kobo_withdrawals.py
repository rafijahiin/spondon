"""Remove records from Spondon after they are deleted in KoboToolbox.

Why this is a reconciliation and not a webhook
----------------------------------------------
KoboToolbox fires its REST Services hook when a submission is CREATED or
edited. There is no "submission deleted" event, so nothing can be pushed to us.
The only reliable signal is the absence of an id: we ask Kobo which submissions
it still holds and compare that with what we stored.

That inversion is dangerous by nature. "Kobo did not return this id" is the
same observation whether the record was genuinely deleted or the request simply
failed, and acting on a bad read would wipe live programme data. Every guard
below exists to make a partial read impossible to mistake for a deletion:

  * every deployed survey asset must be listed AND fully paged, or the run
    aborts before touching anything;
  * a run that sees zero live ids aborts, because an empty account is far more
    likely to be a broken token than a real mass deletion;
  * a run that would remove more than `max_delete` records aborts and asks for
    an explicit override, so one bad day cannot cascade;
  * nothing is removed without `--apply`; the default is a dry run.

Records that cannot be deleted because a service record still points at them
are reported as blocked, never force-cascaded. programs.Client carries
on_delete=PROTECT from every clinic, counselling, referral and supply row, so
the database refuses to orphan a woman's service history. That refusal is
correct and is surfaced rather than worked around.

Every removal is written to KoboWithdrawal first, with a snapshot of the row,
so a deletion can always be explained and, if it was a mistake, rebuilt.
