"""One-time backlog approval for the F-01 Wellness Logbook.

Before the 2026-07 MIS rewire the logbook fed no indicator, so 450+ real Bandhu
service rows sat PENDING. Now that the logbook IS the counted service source,
this approves that pre-rewire backlog so the numbers show on the dashboard.

BOUNDED by a fixed cutoff (created_at < CUTOFF) so it is SAFE to run on every
boot: it only ever touches the old backlog, never future submissions — those keep
the normal two-stage (manager -> UNFPA) review.
