"""Run the Kobo deletion sweep on a schedule, inside the web process.

Why in-process and not a cron service
-------------------------------------
The programme runs on one Railway service with a hard ceiling of five dollars a
month. A second service purely to run one command a day would be a large share
of that budget. A daemon thread inside the existing worker costs effectively
nothing: one pass is about two dozen HTTPS reads and a primary-key scan.

The worker recycles every 500 requests, so the thread dies and is recreated
often. That is why the schedule lives in the database (KoboSyncRun) rather than
in memory: on start the thread asks when the last pass finished, not how long
it has personally been alive. Without that, a busy day would run the sweep
dozens of times.

Safety
------
An unattended pass deletes with a much tighter cap than a person would use. A
human running the command can look at what they are about to remove and pass
--force; a thread cannot, so anything larger than AUTO_MAX_DELETE is recorded
and left for a person. Every other guard in kobo_withdrawals applies unchanged,
including the refusal to act on a partial read of KoboToolbox.

Disabled unless KOBO_DELETION_SYNC names the organisations to sweep, so it can
never start acting on a deployment nobody meant to enable it on.
