"""In-process periodic reconciliation so the CIPRB health strip stays fresh.

Runs `reconcile_ciprb` on a timer and stores a snapshot, which the dashboard
reads via /api/mpdsr/reconciliation/. This is the same pattern as
programs/resync_loop.py (Railway can't add a cron schedule from the CLI), but it
is HEAVIER — each tick pulls every current CIPRB submission for all forms and
replays them through the handlers inside a rolled-back savepoint — so it runs on
a long interval and is OFF by default.

Nothing the tick writes to the domain tables persists: the replay is rolled back
inside a savepoint and only the snapshot row is committed (see
mpdsr.reconcile.run_and_store). It never sends an alert of any kind — the stored
snapshot, surfaced on the dashboard, is the whole point.

Enable with ENABLE_RECON_LOOP=1 on the web service. A Railway cron service
running `python manage.py reconcile_ciprb` on a schedule is an equivalent and
isolation-wise cleaner alternative; running both is harmless (each tick just
writes a fresh snapshot and the newest wins).
