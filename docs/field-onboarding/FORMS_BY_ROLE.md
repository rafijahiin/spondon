## Notes

- **GBV form** is sensitive (encrypted PII). Restrict the link to trained counsellors only — don't put it in the general broadcast group.
- **MPDSR + Fistula Corner** are not for general field staff. CIPRB clinical / hospital focal only.
- **KF-20 Training URL** was previously suspected as a duplicate of KF-02; confirmed via Kobo API that KF-20's correct URL is `https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/bRmo6yVq` and the actual mismatch was KF-02 (now fixed).
- If a worker submits the wrong form, manager rejects with reason "wrong form — please use [correct one]" and the system tells them to resubmit.
