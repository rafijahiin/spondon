Static demo data for the three report generators.

Derived from the UNFPA Bangladesh Country Programme Evaluation 2022–2026
(CPE Draft 2, November 2025) at CIPRB implementation-partner scale.

Purpose
-------
Allow stakeholders to preview the infographic, newsletter, and presentation
reports before live field submissions have accumulated in the database.

The dict returned by get_demo_data() is structurally identical to the output
of collect_programme_data(), so it flows through the same generator pipeline
as real approved submissions.

Remove or archive this module once ≥ 12 months of live data are available.

Annual Programme Summary — PHD & Bandhu Social Welfare Society (2024)

Programme Overview
PHD and Bandhu Social Welfare Society collectively delivered 18,264 approved \
programme activities during the 2024 reporting year across Cox's Bazar, Dhaka, \
Chittagong, Sylhet, Narayanganj, and Comilla — the six priority districts covered \
under CIPRB's UNFPA-funded Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) programme.

Clinical Services
Clinic visits (2,940) and HIV/STI tests (2,724) led the activity count, reflecting \
the scale of both partners' service delivery. PHD recorded 804 antenatal cards, \
contributing to national progress toward Bangladesh's 69.8% skilled birth attendance \
target (DHS 2022). HTC counselling (1,560 sessions) and mental health screenings (720) \
addressed psychosocial needs — particularly among Rohingya and host communities in \
Cox's Bazar.

Community Outreach
Community-level reach remained strong: 2,148 outreach sessions, 2,652 individual \
counselling engagements, and 1,344 hygiene kit distributions reached key populations — \
including female sex workers, transgender persons, and men who have sex with men — \
served by Bandhu across urban sites. 564 GBV cases were documented and referred \
through the protection pathway.

Fistula and MPDSR
43 obstetric fistula cases were identified and referred for corrective surgery, \
contributing to the national total of 522 documented by UNFPA partners in 2024 \
(CPE Table 8). 20 maternal and perinatal death surveillance (MPDSR) cases were \
recorded and investigated across both organisations, supporting national cause-of-death \
disaggregation across all 64 districts.

Performance Context
Against Bangladesh's national maternal mortality ratio of 136 per 100,000 live births \
(CPE Annex 8, 2024) and with 73% of Upazila Health Complexes now operational with \
midwifery services, CIPRB's field activities continue to close service gaps through \
PHD's maternal health mandate and Bandhu's key-population HIV/STI response. \
Family planning met need stands at 73.9% nationally (DHS 2022); CIPRB's FP \
referral and counselling activities directly support progress toward this target.

Note: This report uses illustrative data from the UNFPA Bangladesh CPE 2022–2026 \
(Draft 2, November 2025). It demonstrates the IDMS reporting pipeline. Live field \
submissions will replace this content once the system is in active use.
