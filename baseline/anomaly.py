"""Adapter: run the vendored FSW anomaly engine over our Kobo submissions.

Our `KoboSubmission.raw_data` is nested Kobo JSON keyed by xform FIELD NAMES
(`grp_admin/dc_code`, `b109` as a space-separated code string, a geopoint packed
as "lat lon alt acc"). The engine (see baseline/fsw_rules.py) is written against
flat records where select_multiple answers are split into `Question/Choice`
columns and a few identity fields are resolvable. This module bridges the two:

  * flatten group keys,
  * decode the select_one fields whose rules read the answer as TEXT
    (consent, b103 living arrangement, b105 duration category),
  * expand every select_multiple into `Label/ChoiceLabel` columns so the
    mutually-exclusive / "Other"-without-specify / Q9.5>5 rules can see them,
  * inject the enumerator NAME (from the roster, never the Kobo login),
    the GPS lat/lon/precision (parsed from the geopoint), and a total expenses,
  * pin an EXPLICIT field map (README: lock resolved keys so a wording change
    cannot silently remap a field).

Raw Kobo data is never modified — we build throwaway dicts for the scan.

#     "Did not need assistance" + citing an access barrier.
#   NOT configured — "Don't know" on health-KNOWLEDGE lists (q3_2/3/4/10:
#     partial knowledge + DK is common respondent behaviour, per the manual
#     audit) and "Did not know where to go"-style REASONS (legitimately
